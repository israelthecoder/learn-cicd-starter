This is a manual migration process since you cannot access the old dashboard to use migration plugins.
CRITICAL CHECK:
Before proceeding, confirm you have two things in your backup:
The Files: (Folders like wp-content, wp-admin, wp-includes, and files like wp-config.php).
The Database: A file ending in .sql (e.g., backup.sql or databasename.sql).
If you only have the files but not the .sql database file, your content (posts, pages, settings) is gone. You cannot restore the site without the database.
Assuming you have both, here is the step-by-step guide to hosting your site on QServers (which uses cPanel).
Step 1: Purchase Hosting and Get Access
Sign up for a hosting plan on QServers.
Check your email for the Welcome Email. It contains your cPanel login details and Nameservers.
Log in to your QServers cPanel.
Step 2: Upload Your Website Files
In cPanel, look for File Manager.
Open the public_html folder (this is the root folder for your main website).
If there are default files there (like index.php or default.html provided by the host), delete them.
Click Upload in the top bar.
Upload your backup files.
Tip: If your backup is a folder, zip it into a .zip file on your computer first, upload the zip, and then click Extract inside the File Manager.
Important: Ensure your files are directly inside public_html.
Wrong: public_html/my_backup_folder/wp-content
Right: public_html/wp-content
If they are in a sub-folder, select all files and "Move" them to public_html.
Step 3: Create a New Database
You need to create a container for your data on the new host.
Go back to the cPanel main dashboard.
Click MySQL Databases.
Create New Database: Give it a name (e.g., site_db) and click Create.
Create New User: Scroll down to "Add New User." Create a username and a strong password.
Save this password in a notepad now; you will need it in Step 5.
Add User to Database: Scroll down to "Add User to Database." Select the user you just made and the database you just made. Click Add.
On the next screen, check the box ALL PRIVILEGES and click Make Changes.
Step 4: Import Your Old Database
Now you need to put your old data into the new database.
Go back to the cPanel dashboard.
Click phpMyAdmin.
On the left sidebar, click the name of the database you created in Step 3.
Click the Import tab at the top.
Click Choose File and select your .sql backup file from your computer.
Click Go (or Import) at the bottom. You should see a success message.
Step 5: Connect the Files to the Database
Your files are uploaded, but they are still trying to connect to your old hosting database credentials. You must update them.
Go back to File Manager > public_html.
Look for a file named wp-config.php.
Right-click it and select Edit.
Look for these lines and change the values to the NEW details you created in Step 3:
code
PHP
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'your_new_database_name' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'your_new_database_user' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'your_new_database_password' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' ); // Usually leave this as localhost
Click Save Changes.
Step 6: Point Your Domain (DNS)
If your domain name was bought somewhere else (like GoDaddy or Namecheap), you need to tell it to point to QServers.
Go to where you bought your domain.
Find Nameserver Settings.
Change them to the Nameservers provided in your QServers welcome email. They usually look like:
ns1.qservers.net
ns2.qservers.net
Wait for propagation (can take 1-24 hours).
Step 7: Final Troubleshooting
Once the domain propagates:
Log in to WordPress: Go to yourdomain.com/wp-admin.
Fix Permalinks: Go to Settings > Permalinks and simply click Save Changes (you don't need to change anything, just clicking save resets the link structure).
Search and Replace (Optional): If your domain name changed (e.g., from oldsite.com to newsite.com), you will need to install a plugin like "Better Search Replace" to update the URLs in the database.
Your site should now be live on QServers!
